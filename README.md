The task was to program a processor with a simple instruction set.

Contains:
- cpu.vhd - VHDL code
- project1.pdf - Project specification
- login.b - input file for VHDL code using a simple instruction set
- log.txt - report from automatic tests
- login.png - printscreen from simulation executing program login.b

Important note:

The files here are only the assignment description and code that was created/edited by me.
Files used for testing were provided by my teachers and would need to be added subsequently if needed.
